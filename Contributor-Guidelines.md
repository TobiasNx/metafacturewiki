# Writing good git commit messages

[guidelines](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)

1. The subject line should not exceed 50 characters
1. Do not end the subject line with a period
1. Separate subject line and body with a blank line
1. Capitalise the subject line
1. Use the imperative mood in the subject line. Do not use past tense
1. Wrap body at 72 characters
1. Use the body to explain _what_ and _why_, not _how_
